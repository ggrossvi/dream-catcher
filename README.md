# Project Dream Catcher

## Motivation
Our motivation was participation in the Hackbox challenge and the challenge was the Women in Cloud project. 

The platform aims to amplify the power of a global network of 100,000 women in cloud computing, offering personalized support, networking opportunities, and skill-enhancement resources.

## What the application does
Our tool facilitates finding jobs, connecting with people from that that organization, requesting warm introductions, and tracking the impact of networking efforts. It will assist member in connecting with relevant individuals for job opportunities, partnerships, and event participation. Networking is the best way to find jobs and partnerships.

1st iteration: 

Created text to speech(TTS) functionality that allows members to listen to the listed events hands free. This allow fitting in finding out relevent oportunities easily into their workday.

2st iteration:

Create a tool that allows members to post job descriptions available within their company.  

It sends an email to the member letting them know that a fellow cloud member applied to it. Referrals increase the chance of getting that first interview screen. 

It links back to the member that posted it to connect to request a warm introduction.  

Extend text to speech functionality to job postings.

3rd iteration:
Set up dashboard to track this data with Power Bi.

## Why the selected Technologies

We decided to use React because of its potential to reuse components. Since we were going to create user cards we thought that it would be a good strategy to be able to be able to add and reuse components as we needed.  

The chose of using MySQl was ease of use. In the future we would use Cosmos DB.  

## Challenges 

Due to unforseen circumstances our group dropped down to 2 active participats at the end. This was challenging because of the short amount of time of the hackathon. We had to pivot at the end from our original vision to something more pared down.
